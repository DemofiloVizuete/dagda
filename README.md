# check_docker_image
**check_docker_image** is a tool to perform static analysis of known vulnerabilities in docker images/containers.

To fulfill its mission, the known vulnerabilities CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and BIDs (Bugtraq IDs) and exploits from Offensive Security Exploit Database are imported into a MongoDB to facilitate search and processing of these vulnerabilities and exploits.

Finally, each docker image scan result is stored into the same MongoDB for be capable of retrieve the vulnerabilities history of each docker image/container when you need.

## Requirements
Before **check_docker_image** usage, you must have installed Python >= 3.4.5 and the requirements:

* Python3.4.5 or later
* MongoDB 2.4 or later
* Docker
* Pip3
  * PyMongo
  * Requests
  * Progressbar2
  * Docker-py

The requirements can be installed with pip:
```
    sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation of Docker

You must have installed Docker for using **check_docker_image**. If you need instructions for Docker installation, see the [How-to install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/step_one/) page.

To avoid having to use `sudo` when you use the `docker` command, create a Unix group called `docker` and add users to it. When the `docker` daemon starts, it makes the ownership of the Unix socket read/writable by the `docker` group.

### Installation of MongoDB

You must have installed MongoDB 2.4 or later for using **check_docker_image** because in MongoDB are stored both the vulnerabilities/exploits and the docker images scan results.

If you need instructions for MongoDB installation, see the [How-to install MongoDB Community Edition](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/) page.

You can also run MongoDB using docker:
```
    docker pull mongo
    docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

## Populating the database

For the initial run, you need to populate the vulnerabilities and the exploits in the database by running:
```
    python3 vuln_db.py --init
```

If you need repopulating your database for update with the new vulnerabilities and exploits, you only need rerun the previous command.

Also, you can run queries on your personal database with this tool. Below, the help when you type `python3 vuln_db.py -h` is shown:
```
    usage: vuln_db.py [-h] [--init] [--bid BID] [--cve CVE]
                      [--exploit_db EXPLOIT_DB] [--product PRODUCT]
                      [--product_version PRODUCT_VERSION] [--only_check] [-v]

    Your personal CVE, BID & ExploitDB database.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --init                initializes your local database with all CVEs provided
                            by NIST publications, all BugTraqs Ids (BIDs)
                            downloaded from the "http://www.securityfocus.com/"
                            pages (See my project "bidDB_downloader"
                            [https://github.com/eliasgranderubio/bidDB_downloader]
                            for details) and all exploits from Offensive Security
                            Exploit Database. If this argument is present, all
                            CVEs, BIDs and exploits of your local database will be
                            removed and then, will be inserted again with all
                            updated CVEs, BIDs and exploits.
      --bid BID             all product with this BugTraq Id (BID) vulnerability
                            will be shown
      --cve CVE             all products with this CVE vulnerability will be shown
      --exploit_db EXPLOIT_DB
                            all products with this Exploit_DB Id vulnerability
                            will be shown
      --product PRODUCT     all CVE/BID vulnerabilities and exploits of this
                            product will be shown
      --product_version PRODUCT_VERSION
                            extra filter for product query about its CVE/BID
                            vulnerabilities and exploits. If this argument is
                            present, the "--product" argument must be present too
      --only_check          only checks if "--product" with "--product_version"
                            has CVE/BID vulnerabilities or exploits but they will
                            not be shown
      -v, --version         show the version message and exit
```

Fulfilling with the described usage, a usage example would be the next one (Keep in mind that `--product_version` is a optional argument)
```
    python3 vuln_db.py --product openldap --product_version 2.2.20
```

The expected output is shown below:
```
    [
        "CVE-2005-4442",
        "CVE-2006-2754",
        "CVE-2006-6493",
        "CVE-2006-5779",
        "CVE-2007-5707",
        "CVE-2007-5708",
        "CVE-2011-4079",
        "BID-83843",
        "BID-83610"
    ]
```

### Database contents

The database is called `vuln_database` and there are 3 collections:

* cve (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure items) - source NVD NIST
* bid (BugTraqs Ids items from `http://www.securityfocus.com/`) - source [bidDB_downloader](https://github.com/eliasgranderubio/bidDB_downloader)
* exploit_db (Offensive Security - Exploit Database) - source [Offensive Security](https://github.com/offensive-security/exploit-database)

## Usage
**IMPORTANT NOTE:** In this **check_docker_image** version, the `docker pull` command must be run out-of-the-box because this functionality is not included. That is way, the docker image must be in the host when you run `check_docker_image`.

Below, the help when you type `python3 check_docker_image.py --help` is shown:

```
    usage: check_docker_image.py [-h] [-i DOCKER_IMAGE] [-c CONTAINER_ID]
                                 [--show_history] [-v]

    Your personal docker image security scanner.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -i DOCKER_IMAGE, --docker_image DOCKER_IMAGE
                            the input docker image name
      -c CONTAINER_ID, --container_id CONTAINER_ID
                            the input docker container id
      --show_history        the security scan history for the requested docker
                            image will be shown order by date from the newest to
                            oldest
      -v, --version         show the version message and exit
```

Fulfilling with the described usage, a usage example would be the next one (note that the expected output has been shortened):
```
	python3 check_docker_image.py --docker_image jboss/wildfly
```

The expected output is shown below:
```
    {
        "total_products": 182,
        "ok_products": 161,
        "vuln_products": 21,
        "image_name": "jboss/wildfly",
        "timestamp": "2016-11-15 19:57:57.548829",
        "evaluated_packages_info": [{
            "product": "sed",
            "status": "OK",
            "version": "4.2.2"
        }, {
            "product": "grep",
            "status": "VULN",
            "version": "2.20"
        }, {
            "product": "lua",
            "status": "VULN",
            "version": "5.1.4"
        },
        [...]
        , {
            "product": "sqlite",
            "status": "OK",
            "version": "3.7.17"
        }]
    }
```
